# Cats-vs-Dogs-Classifier

This repositry allows to classify an image either as a cat or a dog. We have built a 3 block CNN model from scratch which gave a testing accuracy of about 87% and then to increase the accuracy we used Transfer Learning which increased the testing accuracy to about 97%.

The entire code has been explained in the form of comments which have been added to the files itself.

We saved 2 models, 3 block CNN model and Transfer Learning model, but they couldn't be uploaded here due to their large size. The models have been saved on google drive and can be downloaded from the below given links

[3 Block VGG Model.h5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cxRClyTNeZhUQp_llzS0kfXTr0OWgAlH/view?usp=sharing) - This model has an  accuracy of about 87%.
[Transfer Learning Model.h5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NbA4lh6CkkRz8jWrUi6xyFcZC9_LW6a9/view?usp=sharing) - This model has an accuracy of about 97%.
